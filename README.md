# 🏠 Hacienda

**AI-powered video captioning agent** — built for **Track 2** of the [LabLabAI × AMD Developer Hackathon: ACT II](https://lablab.ai).

Hacienda watches a video so you don't have to. It downloads clips, samples keyframes, transcribes audio, writes a self-verified scene description, and turns it into four stylistically distinct captions — all inside a single Docker container, within the harness's 10-minute budget.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Grounded caption pipeline** — describe → self-verify against the frames → write each style from the verified description only, so style writers can't hallucinate visual details they never saw
- **Adaptive frame sampling** — picks 8–24 keyframes (896 px, high quality) scaled to clip duration, chunked for long videos
- **Audio transcription** — extracts speech via [Groq Whisper](https://groq.com/) (large-v3) when an audio track is present
- **Multi-style captioning** — generates `formal`, `sarcastic`, `humorous_tech`, and `humorous_non_tech` captions per clip, each with tone-anchoring few-shot examples and structural variety across styles
- **Rule enforcement with repair** — validates word count (15–30), single sentence, no hedging, no medium references, no tech words in `humorous_non_tech`; violations trigger targeted rewrite calls, never truncation
- **Time-budget governor** — tasks run in parallel (5 workers) and generation degrades gracefully (`full` → `no_verify` → `direct`) as the deadline approaches, with results snapshotted after every task
- **Optional deep QA** — best-of-N candidate generation, cross-model judging, and weak-style regeneration for offline runs (`HACIENDA_DEEP_QA=1`)
- **Resilient by construction** — retry with exponential backoff on 429/5xx, layered fallbacks (grounded → direct single-pass → single-frame → templates), every task always produces valid output

### Pipeline modules

| Module | File | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| **Reader** | `pipeline/reader.py` | Resolves I/O paths, downloads video clips, reads/writes JSON |
| **Extractor** | `pipeline/extractor.py` | Uses `ffprobe`/`ffmpeg` to get duration, sample frames (896 px), and extract 16 kHz mono WAV audio |
| **Transcriber** | `pipeline/transcriber.py` | Sends audio to Groq's Whisper-large-v3 endpoint for speech-to-text |
| **Captioner** | `pipeline/captioner.py` | Describe → verify → per-style caption writing, rule validation, and targeted repair |
| **Evaluator** | `pipeline/evaluator.py` | Scores captions on `accuracy` / `style_match` and ranks best-of-N candidate pools (deep QA mode) |
| **Gemma Client** | `gemma_client.py` | OpenAI-compatible client for Fireworks AI with retry/backoff, JSON extraction, and configurable generation/judge models |

## 🚀 Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (or Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coatmol/Hacienda.git
cd Hacienda
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root (already in `.gitignore`):

```env
HACIENDA_GEMMA_BASE_URL=https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1
HACIENDA_GEMMA_TOKEN=your-fireworks-api-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
```

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HACIENDA_GEMMA_BASE_URL` | — | Base URL of the Fireworks AI inference endpoint |
| `HACIENDA_GEMMA_TOKEN` | — | Bearer token for Fireworks AI (API key) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | — | API key for Groq's Whisper audio transcription |
| `HACIENDA_VISION_MODEL` | `minimax-m3` | Vision model used for describe/verify and direct generation |
| `HACIENDA_JUDGE_MODEL` | `glm-5p2` | Judge model for deep QA scoring (should differ from the vision model; falls back to it on failure) |
| `HACIENDA_WORKERS` | `5` | Parallel task workers |
| `HACIENDA_TIME_BUDGET` | `540` | Wall-clock budget in seconds; generation degrades as it runs out |
| `HACIENDA_DEEP_QA` | off | Set to `1` to enable best-of-N + self-eval + regeneration |

### 3. Build & run with Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This automatically injects your `.env` and live-mounts the project directory.

### 4. Or build & run manually (simulates the judging harness)

```bash
docker build -t hacienda .
docker run --rm \
  -v ${PWD}/examples:/input \
  -v ${PWD}/output:/output \
  hacienda
```

Note: no `--env-file` — this verifies the baked `.env` works exactly as it will under the harness. The first log line should read `Models: generation=..., judge=...`; if it says `FATAL CONFIG`, the image has no usable credentials.

## 📦 Runtime contract

The hackathon judging harness mounts volumes at fixed paths and enforces a **~10-minute wall-clock limit**:

| Direction | Container path | Local fallback |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Input** | `/input/tasks.json` | `inputs/tasks.json` |
| **Output** | `/output/results.json` | `output/results.json` |

`results.json` is rewritten after every completed task (in input order), so even a hard kill leaves valid captions for everything finished so far.

### Input format (`tasks.json`)

```json
[
  {
    "task_id": "v1",
    "video_url": "https://example.com/clip.mp4",
    "styles": ["formal", "sarcastic", "humorous_tech", "humorous_non_tech"]
  }
]
```

### Output format (`results.json`)

```json
[
  {
    "task_id": "v1",
    "captions": {
      "formal": "A person walks through a sunlit corridor while examining the surrounding architecture, pausing at each doorway to look inside before continuing toward the far exit.",
      "sarcastic": "Someone strolls down a sunlit corridor inspecting doorways with the gravity of a building inspector who has definitely never approved anything on the first visit.",
      "humorous_tech": "A person traverses the sunlit corridor door by door like a crawler indexing every room, politely ignoring the ones that return nothing interesting.",
      "humorous_non_tech": "A visitor wanders the bright corridor peeking through each doorway like a hotel guest convinced a better room exists somewhere on this floor."
    }
  }
]
```

Each caption is a single English sentence, 15–30 words (the pipeline targets 25–29 for evidence density), faithful to the visual and audio evidence, with no hedging or references to the medium.

## 🧪 Offline tools

Iterate locally instead of burning leaderboard submissions:

```bash
# Score an existing output/results.json against the clips with the judge model
python scripts/benchmark.py [tasks.json] [results.json]

# Discover which vision models your API token can actually use
python scripts/probe_models.py [model-id ...]
```

---

## 🐳 Building for submission

To securely bake credentials into the final image for judging without exposing them in your GitHub repository:

1. Ensure your `.env` file contains your actual API keys.
2. `.dockerignore` **includes** `.env` during the build, while `.gitignore` prevents it from being pushed to GitHub.
3. Build, verify, and push the image:

```bash
docker build -t your-username/hacienda:latest .
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/examples:/input -v ${PWD}/output:/output your-username/hacienda:latest
docker push your-username/hacienda:latest
```

The `GemmaClient` loads the baked `.env` at runtime and ignores empty-string environment presets, so the image works whether or not the harness injects any environment variables.
